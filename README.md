# Hello! My name is Martin 👨‍💻

After a bachelor in Web Marketing and 2, 5 years as a Web Marketer (SEO, Growth, UX), I did the bootcamp Le Wagon in order to acquire tech skills and become a freelance front-end developer.

But I'm open to all opportunities!

Feel free to contact me on my different networks:

My portfolio is coming soon 👀
