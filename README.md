# Hello! My name is Martin & I'm a freelance web developer 👨‍💻

💻 My specialty: turning your Figma (or other) designs into thoughtful, responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly experiences.

📦 Favorite stack: React, Next.js, Tailwind — with a soft spot for CMSs like Webflow, Prismic, and Strapi.

🌱 Background in web development, design, and marketing (EEMI, HÉTIC & Le Wagon), so I also speak the language of product and growth.


I work well both independently and as part of a team. I enjoy projects where there’s room to do things right, and I’m currently available for freelance missions — preferably mid to long term, but I’m open to short-term projects if there’s a good fit.

📍 Based in Spain (always happy to meet in person if possible 🙂)
